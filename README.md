# Object-Detection-
Creating accurate Machine Learning Models which are capable of identifying and localizing multiple objects in a single image remained a core challenge in computer vision. But, with recent advancements in Deep Learning, Object Detection applications are easier to develop than ever before. TensorFlowâ€™s Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.

Here I just Detect the object near by me with name and  the accuracy of the object detected.
